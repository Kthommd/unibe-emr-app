# Public Assets

This directory is intended for static assets that are served at the root of the application. Files placed here will be copied into the production build as-is.

- **images**: icons, logos, or other image assets.
- **fonts**: custom font files.
- **miscellaneous**: any other static files (e.g., `robots.txt`, `manifest.json`).

Because the Vite build pipeline handles most static resources imported in source code, this folder is left empty by default. If you need to add custom assets that aren't imported from your code, place them in this directory.
